# TensorBoard basics

In this Program I am just testing out tensorboard. To start, install tensorflow 1.4 or later. Tensorboard gets installed with tensorflow. Python version is 3.6

Run the simple MNIST classification example by running
python tensorboard_basic.py


Then run
tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow_logs 

Then
in the browser, type http://0.0.0.0:6006/ and press Enter.
